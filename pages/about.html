			<h1>About Myself</h1>
			<h2>As a high schooler, I think it's important to introduce <br>
				myself before we begin making websites.</h2>

				<p>
					Hello, I am Youssef Rachad. I attend École Secondaire Roméo-Dallaire and as part of my English 12 class, 
					I am writing a website on getting organised by making your own HTML creation. I have quite a lot of experience
					writing code from my programming classes and the enormous free time I spend exploring code. My first big website
					is this <a href="../Page_Telescope/page.html" target="_blank">one</a> and it has inspired me to continue developping
					websites. <br> <br>
					You can now see why, when Mrs. Laurin announced that a blog was a possible format for this semester's 
					ISU, I did not hesitate to choose it. This time however, I would like to share this passion of mine with you.
					 <br> <br></p>

					<br> <br><p>
					Wether you're a high school student trying to set yourself up for success (I know I am!) or deciding to learn the 
					skills you need to code a website through a concrete application, this blog will be a great oppurtunity for you to 
					learn and experience the joys of getting organised. It doesn't sound very amusing at first, but trust me, this will
					get interesting very quickly. <br> <br> 
					Personnally, I am doing this project to better myself in my English class, and also to
					prepare myself for university, where I hope to study mechatronics engineering. In fact, the spirit of engineering lies
					in being organised, from planning to scheduling deadlines, and even recording feedback. I will use these various 
					aspects to measure my performance, though I invite you to do the same if you have ongoing projects and would like to 
					stay on top of your tasks. <br> <br>
					When I'm not coding, I like to read while drinking tea. Mint tea, green tea, lemon & ginger tea, whith or without honey
					/milk, you name it! As for my reading material, it has great diversity since I read up on current events and visit old
					classics, adding on that my bilingualism and the cornucopia of litterary works never ceases to run dry. More specifically,
					I often read adventure books from H.G. Wells and Jules Vernes because they remind me that life is not about the destination,
					it's about the journey. <br> <br>
					So embark with me as I go exploring far and wide in search of different strategies to get organised and wield the power of HTML at its 
					fullest potential.
