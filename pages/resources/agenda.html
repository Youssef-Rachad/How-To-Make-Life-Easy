				<em>I am going to make this example all about my book club</em> I am reading a book called <em>The Orenda</em>
				and it's going great. I mean, very few books describe with high precision the process of hypothermia as a young Jesuit is going through a meltdown. I found a great picture of the <a href="" target="_blank">book</a> f

			   <h3>Litterary Theory</h3>
            <p>
				It's no coincidence that I am reading this book. In fact, I am studying litterary theory and how it applies within the societal dynamics in the book.
				For instance, a hegemony is, in essence the societal norms and standards everyon follows, whether you like it or not. That last part is where conflict comes into play. You see, not everyone can fit within said hegemony, they are called the Other. If a character bends and complies, they are a submissive character. However, if they rise to the occasion and stand up for themselves, they are a subversive character.
            </p>
            <h2>Marxist Theory</h2>
            <p>Marxist Theory applies greatly in the Orenda. It deals with systems and how they oppress certain groups. The focus is also put on how the victims react. According to Marx, those group will eventually revolt, should they wish to survive. <em>The Orenda</em> deals with colonisation and the cruel way Champlain destroyed Wendat people. Not litteraly, but think about it. How would you feel if some yahoo landed on your shores and told you your weapons were toys. Do you really think it was a natural thing for Europeans to put themselves as Superiors to the First Nations?</p>

				That was only one example. There are other theories, listed below:

					<li>1. Feminist Theory</li>
					<li>2. Psychoanalytic Theory</li>
					<li>3. PostColonial Theory</li>

                I am going to cut my example short. That being said, your time and your creativity are at play when you take on this feat on your own. Wield both of these correctly and go off experimenting with different methods to create something truly spectacular.
